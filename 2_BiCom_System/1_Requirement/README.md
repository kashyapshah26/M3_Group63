## **WHAT** 
BiCom System for Car is a system that uses a 40-bit rolling code that creats an encryption in between the key and car (transmitter and recever).

## **WHO**
 Any person who is having car that is able to use this type of tecnology.

## **WHERE**
* Inside and Outside car
* At particular range for instance 50 to 60 feet far from the vehicle.

* When we need to lock, unlock doors and identify car
* when we need to check the status of the door , alarm , car battery and window.

## **WHY**
*Better Security - Traditional keys are easy to lose, can be copied easily, and are simply outdated when it comes to modern security locks. 
*BiCom System systems require every authorized user to have a unique credential that provides them access to the building.

## **HOW**
The keyless remote is actually a radio. This data stream contains command and for security, rolling codes. The remote keyless system's receiver in the car captures the RF signal, extracts it and sends the data stream to the CPU.
